# If a build in hardware UART is used, the TXD Port is given
# with the AVR model by the manufactor.
# If more than one hardware UART is present at your  AVR model,
# you can select the UART with the UART number.
# If you select a Software-UART, the port setting is the same as 
# used by the hardware, but you can override by setting a different UART_TX port.
# Additionally AVR_FAMILY should hold the name of the AVR family,
# which is usually the biggest member like atmega328 for atmega168.
# You can convert the name of the target processor in MCI_TARGET to
# AVR_FAMILY with avr_family.sh .
# Please note, thall all entries in avr_pins let the grep search
# find at lease one TX port. For devices without a hardware UART,
# the TX entry is listed in a unused column.
